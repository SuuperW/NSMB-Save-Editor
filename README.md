# New-Super-Mario-Bros-Save-Editor
A save editor for New Super Mario Bros. for the DS. To get your .SAV savefile, you can choose 'Export Backup Memory' in DeSmuME, 'File' -> 'Save RAM' -> 'Flush Save RAM' in BizHawk, use TWLTool on your 3DS with homebrew, or however else you wish/know how to retrieve a .SAV save from NSMB DS. 

This is a fork of RedStoneMatt's NSMB Save Editor, which is a fork of newluigidev's.
